Perform a 3D Bernard Cell simulation using OpenFOAM. 
The computational domain spans 9 m x 1 m x 2 m. 
The simulation begins at t=0 seconds and runs until t=1000 seconds with a time step of 1 second, 
and results are written at intervals of every 50 seconds. One wall has a temperature of 301 K, while the other has a temperature of 300 K.
